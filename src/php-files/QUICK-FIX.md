# ⚠️ OUTDATED - DO NOT USE THIS FILE

This file is **INCORRECT** and should **NOT** be used.

## ✅ Use These Files Instead:
- **`FIX-HTACCESS-ROOT.md`** - Complete guide
- **`QUICK-FIX-ROOT.md`** - Quick reference  
- **`/server-deploy/.htaccess`** - The correct file to upload to `/public_html/.htaccess`

---

**The .htaccess file goes in the ROOT (`/public_html/.htaccess`), NOT in `/public_html/api/`!**
