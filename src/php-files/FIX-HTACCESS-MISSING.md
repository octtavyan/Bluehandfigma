# ⚠️ OUTDATED - DO NOT USE THIS FILE

This file is **INCORRECT** and should **NOT** be used.

## ❌ Wrong Information
This guide said to put `.htaccess` in `/public_html/api/.htaccess` but that's **WRONG**!

## ✅ Correct Information
The `.htaccess` file should be in the **ROOT** at `/public_html/.htaccess`

## 📖 Use These Files Instead:
- **`FIX-HTACCESS-ROOT.md`** - Correct guide
- **`QUICK-FIX-ROOT.md`** - Quick reference
- **`/server-deploy/.htaccess`** - The correct file to upload

---

**The .htaccess belongs in the ROOT directory, not in /api/!**
